# Marvel Comics Scripts

- **pulls.py** - Generates my weekly pull list, of all in-universe marvel comics.
- **ultimate_reader.py** - Generate ordered reading list of comics in a set of series, in this case the best Ultimate universe comics.

*Note: These don't currently run since the PyMarvel library is really buggy, and I had to patch my local copy. You can grab my branch of PyMarvel to get these to run.*
